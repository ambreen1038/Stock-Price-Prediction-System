# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project predicts stock prices using a deep learning model built with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It leverages historical stock data fetched via Yahoo Finance and applies multiple moving averages to enhance predictions. The model is trained on scaled and sequenced data and then saved along with the scaler for future inference.
